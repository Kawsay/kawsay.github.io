            <h1>A Better Mother Fucking Website</h1>
            <p>It definitly is !</p>

            <h2 align="right">Make sure it works !</h2>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who gives a shit about a pretty website that doen't do the job ?
               1st rule is to make sure your website will do what we fucking ask
               him to !
            </p>
            <br>               

            <h2 >Simple, but still attractive</h2>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's often hard to find the right point between soberty and attractivity.
               Hopefully, you can archieve easy but still nice-looking styles with few lines of <code>CSS</code> ! <strong>Do it !</strong>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2 align="right">Be creative !</h2>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's now about your code, it's about your ideas. Your site looks like Gopher
               or a fucking UNIX's man page ! Tweak some settings to make it looks decent.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Write nice code !</h2>
            <p>A nice should : 
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Respect</em> the community's standards</li>
                    <li>Be commented where needed</li>
                    <li>Be freely accessible, so everyone can play with it</li>
                </ul>
            <br>

            <h2 align="right">Think global</h2>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being on the <em>Application</em> stack of <code>TCP/IP</code> doesn't exclude you
               from diging deeper. Try to regulary read few white pappers to be up to date.
               <blockquote><em>"Code is law, architecture is policy"</em></blockquote>
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Meditate & teach peace</h2>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah, you're coding the World ! Give your best to build sustainable
               systems and make sure to empower peoples and comminities. Respect the Internet,
               cherry it, allow it to shine. <em>Let us proceed together apace.</em>
